Data visualization is a significant aspect of all AI and machine learning applications. With different graphical representations, you can gain important insights about your data. 

Typically, data is visualized in the form of a chart, infographic, diagram or map.

- Identify trends and outliers
- Tell a story within the data
- Reinforce an argument or opinion
- Highlight an important point in a set of data

Python offers several libraries that provide different functions for visualizing data. All of these libraries have different functions and can support different types of graphs. We will discuss three such libraries - Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly

We aim to cover the following types of plots:

- **Relational plots**
  - line plots
  - scatter plots
  - correlation plots
- **Categorical plots**
  - bar plots
  - histogram
  - boxplot
  - count plot
  - point plot
  - distribution plot

We will also learn how to customize and style plots. Throughout the session, we'll discuss the plot types best suited for particular kinds of data.

## 2.2 Prerequisites:
Check if the below libraries are installed.
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) : is a 2D python plotting library which allows you to generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc, with just a few lines of code.
  - [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It's built on top of matplotlib and is tightly integrated with the PyData stack, including support for numpy and pandas data structures and statistical routines from scipy and statsmodels.
  - [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/): is a graphing library makes interactive, publication-quality graphs.    
  - sklearn: To implement Dimentionality reduction
 
Basic familiarity with Python is assumed.
