## 7.1 Introduction to Deep Learning

The deep learning introduction presentation is available [here](https://github.com/sebastianbirk/datascience-bootcamp/blob/main/content/07_deep_learning/07_deep_learning.pptx).

Good introductory courses for deep learning are:
- The Deeplearning.ai [Deep Learning Specialization](https://deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/).
- The Fast.ai [Practical Deep Learning for Coders Course](https://course.fast.ai/).

## 7.2 Deep Learning Lab

### 7.2.1 Setup

- In session 1 "Bootcamp Introduction, Tools Setup & Python Introduction", you have set up Windows Terminal and WSL with an Ubuntu distribution, and have cloned the datascience-bootcamp repository to your local machine. Now, open up your Windows Terminal with the Ubuntu default profile and navigate to this repository (```cd data-science-bootcamp```). Then run ```git pull``` to the get the latest state of this repository from Github.
- Navigate to the deep learning folder by running ```cd content/07_deep_learning``` and install the conda environment that includes all packages needed for this session. You can do this by running ```conda env create -f environment.yml```
- Once the environment is installed, activate it by running ```conda activate datascience-bootcamp-7```. Then launch JupyterLab (```jupyter lab --no-browser```) from within the conda environment.
